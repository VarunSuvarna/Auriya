# Auriya

Auriya is an open-source, NFT-gated hi-fi music platform that merges blockchain transparency, AI-powered personalization, and true lossless audio streaming. By issuing membership NFTs, Auriya grants fans exclusive access to studio-quality FLAC/WAV/DSD, rare mixes, live sessions, and direct artist interaction. Smart contracts automate royalties, ensuring fair, instant payments to all contributors.

# Project Overview

- **Vision:** Democratize premium audio experiences and restore artist value.  
- **Mission:** Deliver studio-master quality music, personalized sound, and transparent compensation in one cohesive ecosystem.  
- **Core Technologies:**  
  - Blockchain (Polygon + IPFS) for NFT access control, decentralized storage, and on-chain royalties  
  - AI (TensorFlow.js & Web Audio API) for real-time audio enhancement and emotional context mapping  
  - Web3 (React.js & Web3.js) for seamless wallet integration and community governance  

## üöÄ Key Features

- **NFT Membership Tiers:** Unique ERC-721 tokens unlock basic to VIP access levels, each granting additional content and perks.  
- **Lossless Streaming:** 24-bit/192 kHz audio formats preserve every nuance of original studio recordings.  
- **AI-Driven Audio Optimization:** Automatic hardware profiling and dynamic EQ, spatialization, and dynamic range adjustments.  
- **Emotional Context Playlists:** Mood and activity detection adapt playback to listener‚Äôs state.  
- **Transparent Royalties:** Smart contracts distribute payments instantly to artists, producers, and contributors per stream.  
- **Community Governance:** Token-weighted voting for new artist spotlights, feature proposals, and exclusive events.  
- **Exclusive Content Vault:** Alternate mixes, stems, behind-the-scenes footage, and live session recordings for NFT holders.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Web3.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity on Polygon (ERC-721 membership, royalty split contracts)  
- **Storage:** IPFS + Pinata for decentralized hosting of high-res audio  
- **AI Modules:** TensorFlow.js models & Web Audio API for client-side processing  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas (metadata & community data)  

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Mint or Import NFT:** User connects MetaMask and mints a membership NFT.  
2. **Unlock Lossless Content:** Frontend verifies NFT ownership and enables high-fidelity streams.  
3. **AI Audio Enhancement:** Client-side AI analyzes user gear and environment, applying real-time optimizations.  
4. **Stream & Interact:** Users enjoy premium tracks, participate in voting, and message artists.  
5. **Automated Royalties:** Each play triggers a smart contract event, instantly distributing funds to contributors.

## üìà Differentiation from Existing Platforms

- **Versus Audius:** Offers true lossless audio and built-in AI personalization rather than compressed streams.  
- **Versus Royal:** Provides ongoing, daily utility‚Äîexclusive streaming and community features‚Äînot just NFT sales.  
- **Versus Sound.xyz:** Delivers a full-scale, interactive streaming service with emotional discovery vs. one-off drops.  
- **Versus Spotify/Tidal:** Ensures fair artist compensation (10√ó earnings) and ad-free, premium experience.
